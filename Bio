   <p><font size="5">Hello everyone, my name is Rhenard Cayabyab. I was born in the Philippines on the 16th of November, 1995. At around 5-years-old, my family and I moved to San Diego, California. I lived a boring life so I joined the army right after high school. After serving for 5 years and after living in Georgia, Texas and Hawaii, I returned to San Diego. During my time in the military, however, I met the love of my life and we made our own little one. She is now 4-and-half-months old and I love her to death! When I am not home, you can find me at a casino, working, or attending dealer school!</font></p>
